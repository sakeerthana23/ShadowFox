# Language Model Exploration and Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates the behavior of a language model to analyze its response characteristics across different types of prompts—ranging from factual queries to creative writing. It explores the relationship between prompt complexity and response length, while addressing research questions around language model capabilities, creativity, and ethical usage.

---

## ✅ Features
- **Simulated AI Responses:** Generate predefined responses to emulate a language model without external API calls.
- **Prompt-Response Analysis:** Examine how prompt complexity affects output length.
- **Visualizations:** Bar plot showcasing response lengths for various input types.
- **Research Integration:** Built-in research questions and ethical considerations.
- **Correlation Insights:** Analyze prompt vs. response length correlation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn pandas numpy
```

## 📂 Project Structure
- **lm_explore.ipynb** – Main script for generating and analyzing simulated responses.
- **README.md** – Project documentation and usage instructions.
- **output.png** – Visualization output of the response lengths.

## 📊 Results and Insights
- Clear variation in response length across prompt types (e.g., factual vs. creative).
- Positive correlation observed between prompt complexity and response length.
- Supports research into creativity, factual accuracy, and model behavior simulation.

---

## 🔍 Research Questions Explored
1. How well does the model retain context in multi-sentence inputs?
2. Is the model capable of creative writing (e.g., poetry)?
3. What limitations does the model have in factual accuracy?
4. How does output length vary with input complexity?
